Automobile Loan Prediction Repository
Welcome to the Automobile Loan Prediction Repository! This repository contains datasets with automobile loan information from India, along with three machine learning models for predicting loan outcomes: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network. Additionally, we provide the original test and train data, updated clean versions of the dataset, custom metrics for evaluation, and a comprehensive data dictionary describing each column in the dataset.

Process Data

Data Cleaning 

Upload CSV, format the date of birth  and dispersal date columns as datetime, format the credit history length and average account age into total  months, and drop the object columns left.

Model Building 

Use the clean CSV to build a Logistic regression model, a deep neural network, and a decision tree model. Run each of these multiple times with different information to see which performs the best. Tune models as much as possible.

Choose Best Model

Compare model performance and choose the model that performs the best. Take note of the lowest accuracy and consider that our baseline when comparing how well the best model performed.

Take the chosen model and attempt to tune a bit more, if it cannot be made better without being overfit then skip this step. Run the final model and record the results. 

Run The Model 

Analyze & Prepare Results For Presentation

Analyze the results, and prepare to make them presentation ready. Use the predictions and calculate the yearly cost of defaults to show how much money is lost to bad loans. Convert that number to USD and present that value.
